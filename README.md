## React Crypto Coin App

A React app that displays cryptocurrency coin data fetched from a cryptocurrency API. It uses Axios for making API requests and React's state management to store and render the coin information. The app consists of components like CoinList and CoinItem to display the list of coins and their details. Styling is applied using CSS or a CSS framework, and error handling is implemented to handle potential API errors. The app can be deployed to a hosting service for public access.

## 1.Real-time Cryptocurrency Data
The React app fetches and displays real-time data for various cryptocurrencies, providing users with up-to-date information on prices, market capitalization, and other essential metrics.

## 2.User-Friendly Interface 
The app features an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the cryptocurrency data effortlessly.

## 3.Automatic Data Refresh
To ensure users always have the latest information, the app automatically refreshes the data at regular intervals, keeping the displayed coin data current.

## 4.Error Handling and Reliabilit
The app incorporates robust error handling, ensuring smooth functionality even when API requests encounter issues, maintaining a reliable user experience.

## 5.Responsive Web Design
The React app is designed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, allowing users to access it from desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
